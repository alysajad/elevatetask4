## Objective

To explore and configure firewall rules using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Kali Linux by:
- Installing and enabling UFW.
- Listing and modifying firewall rules.
- Blocking/allowing specific ports.
- Testing and verifying firewall behavior.
- Reverting test configurations.
- Understanding how firewall rules manage traffic.

## Step-by-Step Process and Analysis

### 1. Opening the Firewall Configuration Tool

- Initially attempted to check UFW status:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw status numbered
  ```
- Output: `command not found`, indicating UFW was not installed.

### 2. Installing UFW

- Installed UFW using APT:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ufw
  ```
- This added the UFW package and created necessary configuration files.

### 3. Checking Current Firewall Rules

- Verified initial status using:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw status numbered
  ```
- Output: `Status: inactive` — confirms firewall was not active.

### 4. Enabling UFW

- Activated the firewall with:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw enable
  ```
- Output confirmed UFW is now active and will start on system boot.

### 5. Adding Rule to Block Port 23 (Telnet)

- Telnet is an insecure protocol, often used in legacy systems. Blocking it prevents unencrypted logins.
- Rule added with:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw deny 23
  ```
- Verified with:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw status numbered
  ```
- Output showed rule entries for port 23 (IPv4 and IPv6).

### 6. Testing Firewall Rule

- Installed telnet client:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install telnet
  ```
- Attempted to connect:
  ```bash
  telnet localhost 23
  ```
- Output: `Connection refused` — indicates the firewall is correctly blocking inbound Telnet requests.

### 7. Adding Rule to Allow SSH (Port 22)

- SSH is commonly used for remote access. Allowing port 22 ensures administrative access is preserved.
- Command used:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 22
  ```

### 8. Removing the Telnet Block Rule

- Deleted the rule blocking port 23 (IPv4) using:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw delete 1
  ```
- Confirmed rule was deleted after prompt.

### 9. Listing Final Rules

- After deletion and addition, confirmed current rules using:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw status numbered
  ```
- SSH allow rule remains; Telnet block rule successfully removed.

## Analysis: How Firewall Filters Traffic

- **Firewall Basics**: Firewalls inspect incoming and outgoing traffic based on rules. They operate at network and transport layers to block or allow data packets.
- **UFW Utility**: UFW simplifies `iptables`, providing user-friendly commands to secure the system.
- **Blocking Telnet**: Protects against potential exploitation from insecure and outdated protocols.
- **Allowing SSH**: Maintains remote management capabilities while ensuring security through encryption.
- **Rule Precedence**: UFW processes rules in order; specific DENY or ALLOW rules are evaluated top-down.

## Security Implications

- Blocking unused or insecure ports (like Telnet) hardens the system against brute force and eavesdropping attacks.
- Allowing only essential services (SSH) minimizes the attack surface.
- Ensuring the firewall is active and persistent through reboots enhances long-term protection.

## Commands Summary

```bash
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status numbered
sudo ufw deny 23
sudo apt install telnet
telnet localhost 23
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw delete 1
sudo ufw status numbered
```

## Conclusion

The task demonstrated the ability to manage basic firewall configurations using UFW in Kali Linux. Blocking, allowing, and removing rules worked as expected. UFW offers a manageable interface to enforce basic network security best practices and protects systems from unauthorized access.
